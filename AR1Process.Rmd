## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r Inflation}
# AR processes: inflation rate
data(Mishkin, package= "Ecdat")
inflation <- as.ts(Mishkin[,1])

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
ts.plot(inflation) ; acf(inflation)
AR_inflation <-arima(inflation, order = c(1,0,0))
print(AR_inflation)

ts.plot(inflation)
AR_inflation_fitted <- inflation - residuals(AR_inflation)
points(AR_inflation_fitted, col = "red", pch = 16)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
